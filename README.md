# Python-MinMaxMean
A simple stats program for crunching the min, max, mean, mode and median of a variable # set of numbers. The current version executes and then exits. I will likely revise at least with a loop to allow the user to keep using until they choose to exit. Later versions may then add more statistical measurements on the same as well.
